                <h4>DTR-001 | Melt-Banana - Charlie (LP) [1998]</h4>
                <p>Charlie features guest appearances by Mike Patton and Mr. Bungle on the song "Area 877 [Phoenix
                    Mix]". Mike Patton says: "MELT... BANANA!" at the beginning of the song and Melt-Banana have sampled
                    this through many of their other songs including "7.2 Seconds Flipping", "Brick Again" and the
                    version of "Bad Gut Missed Fist" on their live album MxBx 1998/13,000 Miles At Light Velocity.

                    Charlie was named after the film of the same name, based on the novel Flowers for Algernon.</p>

                <h4>DTR-002 | Dirty Projectors - The Getty Address (CD) [2005]</h4>
                <p>The album boasts over 25 musicians on it, most of whom contributed to the orchestral and choral
                    backing of the album. These parts were recorded at Yale University as well as other locations in New
                    Haven, Connecticut over a period spanning five months and were chopped up digitally to create the
                    backings of the album. Dave Longstreth then overdubbed his own vocals, guitar, bass, and other
                    instruments to create the songs on the album. Although the lyrics have been described as gibberish,
                    the words actually do tell a narrative beginning with Don Henley contemplating suicide, and ending
                    with a new installment of Longstreth's songs involving brown finches.</p>

                <h4>DTR-003 | Dirty Projectors - Bitte Orca (Cass) [2009]</h4>
                <p>The word "bitte" is a German word for "please", and "orca" is another name for a killer whale.
                    Frontman David Longstreth states that he liked the way the words sound together. Longstreth notes
                    that the music contained within the album "felt very [much] about colors, and their interaction,"[1]
                    and that the music was written with the notion of the band, as a whole, in mind.[1]

                    Two of the album's tracks, "Temecula Sunrise" and "Cannibal Resource", appeared on the subsequent EP
                    release, Temecula Sunrise, alongside two new songs.

                    The album peaked at #65 on the Billboard 200 and #12 on the Independent Albums chart. As of April 4,
                    2012, the album has sold 85,000 copies in the U.S.</p>

                <h4>DTR-004 | Joanna Newsom - Have One on Me (3xLP) [2010]</h4>
                <p>Have One on Me continues Newsom's use of cryptic, pastoral lyrics, with a further progression of
                    elements of her sound such as the orchestral accompaniment and the arrangements – with the inclusion
                    of diverse instruments like the tambura, the harpsichord and the kaval.[2] The production also
                    flirts with genres such as jazz and blues in some of the tracks, while adding drums and the electric
                    guitar in others. The album is also her first since The Milk-Eyed Mender to include songs played on
                    the piano instead of the harp.</p>

                <h4>DTR-005 | Bill Callahan - Apocalypse [2011]</h4>
                <p>Apocalypse is a studio album by Bill Callahan, released on April 5, 2011. It is the third studio
                    album released under his own name, and fourteenth overall when including LPs released as Smog.
                    Mojo and Pitchfork both placed the album at number 23 on their "Top 50 albums of 2011" lists
                    while Uncut placed the album at number 25.</p>

                <h4>DTR-006 | Melt-Banana - Fetch (LP) [2013]</h4>
                <p>It was the band's first album of new material in six years, after Bambi's Dilemma in 2007. The
                    recording sessions for the album had to be postponed due to the Tohoku earthquake and the aftermath
                    of the subsequent meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

                    The album was recorded as a duo, with the vocalist Yasuko Onuki and the guitarist Ichirou Agata
                    opting to use synthesized backing music. Melt-Banana have been performing live as a duo since
                    mid-2012.</p>

                <h4>DTR-007 | Bill Callahan - Dream River [2013]</h4>
                <p>Bill Callahan began writing songs for Dream River in August 2012, with the idea of it becoming an
                    album to listen to late at night. Callahan noted, "[Dream River is] the last record you could listen
                    to at the end of the day, before you go to bed, around midnight. [I wanted it to be] smooth and
                    relaxing, the perfect end to a person's day."

                    Describing his usual recording method as an all-encompassing experience, Callahan notes that the
                    process differed for Dream River: "You sort of dread [recording an album], knowing you have to go
                    into the abyss, because it gets more and more intense, and as the boulder gets bigger and bigger and
                    heavier and heavier, the harder it is to let go. I wanted to see if I could have more of a life, to
                    do other things while I'm making a record. I pretty much did."</p>

                <p>Lavender Country is an American country music band formed in 1972, whose self-titled 1973 album is
                    the first known gay-themed album in country music history.

                <h4>DTR-009 | Joanna Newsom - Divers (Cass) [2015]</h4>
                <p>The album was revealed on August 10, 2015, along with its first song, "Sapokanikan", which was
                    released digitally as the first single. The cover art, album packaging, and music video for the
                    album's title track feature the work of artist Kim Keever. The music video was directed by Paul
                    Thomas Anderson with whom Newsom worked for the film Inherent Vice.

                    Speaking about the album's creative process in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she said "I
                    ... spent a year or two on the instrumental arrangements and overdubs. I wanted the character and
                    colors of the instrumentation to shift definitively, from song to song, which entailed a wide pool
                    of collaborators and a lengthy collaborative process with each person." She further described the
                    process of making the album as "probably the most fun I’ve had making a record". Entertainment
                    Weekly also reported Newsom "as using an arsenal of nearly a dozen keyboards and synths including
                    clavichords, Mellotrons and Marxophones" for the album while members of the City of Prague
                    Philharmonic Orchestra feature as players on the album.</p>

                <p>Recorded during a performance at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee, the album features
                    improvised versions of material taken from the duo's first studio album Coming Apart and the single
                    "The Show Is Over". It continues the project's trend of rejecting traditional musical structures and
                    utilizing various methods of distorting their sound.</p>

                <h4>DTR-011 | Guerilla Toss - Twisted Crystal (LP) [2018]</h4>
                <p>Analog synthesizers give tangible life to the works of Guerilla Toss. Whether it be the sound of a
                    rocket ship, a kitten-with-a-wah, distorted dolphins, or a clavichord made out of honey-baked ham,
                    the band consistently finds new ways to bring together the many ideas that combine to shape each new
                    batch of art-rock puzzle pieces.

                    Twisted Crystal, Guerilla Toss’ new LP, feels more personal than ever for the band. Angular yet
                    irresistibly catchy, this collection of pop songs pulls influence from powerful groups like The
                    Slits, ESG, Gina X, and early Madonna, with sing-speak vocals from Kassie Carlson nodding to
                    legendary artists like Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, and Lizzy Mercier Descloux – combining this all
                    into a twisted, crystalline concoction.
